There are JSON files in the bayesian_opt directory for each hyperparameter combination searched for each model. Each model also has a corresponding .py file designed to run the best hyperparameter combination for a final training of exactly 200 epochs.
To observe this final training, the working directory must be set to the Master Thesis Code folder. Otherwise, the tuner will create a new directory and start searching for hyperparameters again.
